## How to Use:

### What did I learn:
In doing this project, I learned how to incorporate different third party APIs to build a functioning website program. I used Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js to enhance the website on top of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used JavaScript to loop through each hour that I wanted to make a task box for to create the element on the page. I used a for loop to save and pull the data from local storage. I created a function to compare the current hour vs the hour on the time block to apply a color to determine if the time block is in the past, present, or future to help keep track of tasks. This one was really challenging because I wanted to use JavaScript to do all the work for me and keep my code DRY, but it was so satisfying when I got it completed!
